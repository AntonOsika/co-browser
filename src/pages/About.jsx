      <p className="mb-4">
        Welcome to our innovative platform that showcases the power of "layers of ephemerality" in AI-driven software engineering.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What are Layers of Ephemerality?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In our system, we have implemented a fascinating concept where an AI software engineer is capable of editing another AI software engineer. This creates multiple layers of AI interaction, each with varying degrees of permanence or "ephemerality."
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Layer 1: The Foundation</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The first layer consists of the core AI software engineer, which is more stable and persistent. This AI has been trained on a vast amount of programming knowledge and best practices, forming the foundation of our system.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Layer 2: The Ephemeral Editor</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The second layer is where the magic happens. This layer contains another AI software engineer that can edit and modify the first layer. It's more adaptable and "throwaway" in nature, allowing for rapid iterations and experiments without permanently altering the core system.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Power of This Approach</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Rapid Prototyping: The ephemeral layer allows for quick testing of new ideas without risking the stability of the core system.</li>
        <li>Continuous Learning: The interaction between layers creates a feedback loop, potentially improving both AIs over time.</li>
        <li>Flexibility: This approach can adapt to changing requirements or new programming paradigms more easily.</li>
        <li>Safety: By keeping the core layer more stable, we maintain a reliable fallback while exploring new possibilities in the ephemeral layer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This innovative approach to AI-driven software engineering opens up new possibilities for creative problem-solving and adaptive development in the ever-evolving world of technology.
