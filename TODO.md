- classifier step
- let user add actions stored in localstorage
- export/import localstorage
- one terminal, but many "run a process"
- output is always added to context, user decides if it should be put in 
- chat boxes can be collapsed/expanded
- User can add action (groups), toggle:able in AI config view
- "Flavors", focused on different things, both as "forks" and as "groups" of available actions
- user can see all system prompt etc, super transparent what happens (because developer is the user)
- console log all network errors
- record everything that happens with rrweb. Let the AI "Ask" for what happened. Let the AI replay things the user did.

IDEAS:
- accept status. + throw away context. Accepts are persisted after refresh.
- test suite?
